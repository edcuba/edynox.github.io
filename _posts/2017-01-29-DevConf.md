Project is getting its shape and it is time for community discussion. Developer conference DevConf 2017 in Brno(Czech Republic) is
great opportinity to do so. I decided to prepare a short 20 minutes talk about my project and dicuss it with other developers.

You can find presentation slides [here](http://www.stud.fit.vutbr.cz/~xcubae00/devconf.pdf)(live example not included).

Project received some positive feedback and we discussed next steps like integration with PackageKit, failed transaction completion support and possible squash with RPM in the far future.
