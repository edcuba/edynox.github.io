36 hours no sleep, 24 hours of coding and 21 international teams with awesome ideas for Internet of Things.
That was V4 Hackathon 2017 organized by AT&T and CTU specialized on IoT and Data Analytics. Meet RIoT, our solution
for simple Remote controlling your IoT devices.

RIoT android app allows you to open up IoT device options by simply pointing at device with your camera. 
Object recognition is done on local server with image classification library in Python.
Server is also holding list of available devices. When option for device is selected, smartphone will send control request 
to server, which will process request and pass it to particular IoT device. Our application was presented on Raspberry Pi with
matrix display.
