I decided to take an opportunity to participate on open-source project in Red Hat Lab Q at my university.
Project has its origins in master thesis about **Unified software database for RPM based systems** about replacing obsoleted 
YUM databases with new, universal one designed for current needs of package managers in Fedora.

My first task is to edit proposed database design, create schemas and transformation tool, which will migrate package
and transaction data into new database from yumdb and history.sqlite located in /var/lib/dnf.

Nextly, I will create library written in C as part of libdnf which will provide access to this database for DNF.

Last and probably most difficult part is to actually rewrite DNF and replace database calls with a new library ones.
